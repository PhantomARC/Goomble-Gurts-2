—————————————————— About Kittea —————————————————

Kittea.js is a discord bot application designed 
for lookups and other basic data fetching with
regards to the game, Goomble Gurt II. Kittea is 
capable of the following:

• Goomble datasheet lookups

• Move datasheet lookups

• Passive datasheet lookups

———————————————— Pre-requisites ————————————————

To use Kittea.js, you will need the following:

• A folder containing all image sheets for 
	goombles, moves and passives, as well as 
	datasheets for them. The folder must be named
	'lib' (exclude the quote marks). You can get
	this pregenerated folder by running Eggnogg.exe.
	
• 'config.json'; you will need to fill out the
	missing contents, then place the finished file
	in `src/config/`. You can get the token and a
	client ID by creating a new application over at:
	https://discord.com/developers/applications
	The server ID can be obtained by right-clicking
	your desired server and pressing "Copy Server ID".
	You can find the blank copy of 'blank-config.json' 
	in the same folder as Kittea.js.
	
• A Discord bot that has been added to a desired
	server. You can add your Discord bot by using
	the aforementioned link (above).

• node.js v17 or higher. For specific instructions
	on installing node.js on a raspberry pi zero:
	https://hassancorrigan.com/blog/install-nodejs-on-a-raspberry-pi-zero/
	For Windows users, you can get a node.js here: 
	https://nodejs.org/en

• npm as well as certain packages. by default, npm
	comes installed with node.js. Here are the 
	required dependencies, which you can paste into
	cmd to install (in parantheses):
	- discord.js v14 (npm install discord.js)

Note that 'lib' will need to be placed in the 
same folder that Kittea.js is in.

———————————————————— Manual ————————————————————

After grabbing the required files, start by getting
the bot's token, client ID and server ID. Paste 
those values into 'blank-config.json' and rename
that file into 'config.json'. Finally, move that 
file into the config folder located in 'src'.

You will then need to run 'build-kittea.js' once by
calling 'node build-kittea.js' in cmd before the
bot functions properly.

Before running kittea.js, check to see that you have:
• A folder called 'lib' that was generated from 
	eggnogg.exe;
• A folder called 'src'
• 'Kittea.js'
• 'build-kittea.js'
Make sure all of these files and folders are in their
own folder. 

You can now call 'node Kittea.js' to run the bot!

————————————————————— Notes —————————————————————

On Windows, you can open open up cmd by typing
'cmd' (minus the quote marks) into the file explorer
navigation tab (where it says "C:\Users\...\...\")
and then pressing enter. For Linux, cmd represents 
any terminal, which could just be the main screen
for nogui ssh clients.
